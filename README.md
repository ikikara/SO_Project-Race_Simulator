## Notes important to read:
   - In this repository I have a version of this work from 2021 and from 2022. The way to run these 2 versions it's different so check the respective folders to know how to run.
   - This project MUST BE run in Linux (as I said above we will use UNIX specification)
   - The files that are on folder "resources" must be on the same folder of *.c files 
   - For more information about how to use these projects consult the respective Statements (to learn more about commands, signals available and structure of "Config.txt")
